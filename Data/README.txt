The files contained in the TrailDataCSVs folder are raw data CSVs. These were extracted from the GEO-JSON file given to us by John who received it from park services. We have been told that the data is freely available and there should be no problem using it with our project. 

When we store the data for these trails in the database, these are not the files we are using - we are using concatenated versions of these files so that when we have trail1.csv, trail2.csv, â€¦ they become just trailFinal.csv.These files are stored in FinalTrailCSVs.

TableInserts contains the text and CSV files for other table entries in the database.
